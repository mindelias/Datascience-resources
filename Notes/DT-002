# What to expect and what to look for

Data architect and data engineer

and big data architect and big data engineer respectively

are crucial titles on the market.

A person in these roles is regarded

as a very important part of the entire process

of solving a data science or a business task.

A data architect creates databases from scratch.

They design the way data will be retrieved,

processed and consumed.

The tasks of the data engineer step on the work

of the data architect.

His primary job responsibility

is to further process the obtained data

so that it is ready for analysis.

So the result of his work

is something analysts and people in analytics positions

will heavily rely on: a clean and organized dataset.

Great.

In fact, the data in a database is not created once

and for all.

You have a certain flow into and from the database.

And there is a person who handles this control of data.

Her position is database administrator

and she mainly works with traditional data.

Needless to say, administration of big data

A BI analyst will do analyses and reporting

of past historical data.

What a BI consultant does exactly is vague though.

BI consultants are often external BI analysts.

nally, a BI developer is a person

who handles more advanced programming tools,

such as Python and especially SQL

in order to create analyses specifically designed

for the company.

It is the third most frequently encountered job position

in the BI team of a firm

A person who employs traditional statistical methods

or unconventional machine learning techniques

for making predictions

could still be labeled a data scientist.

data analyst is the job title

for those who prepare more advanced types of analyses

and do the basic part of the predictions

of the data science team.

Finally, a machine learning engineer.

This job is tough to do but easy to classify.

It refers to those who are looking for ways

to apply state-of-the-art computational models

developed in the field of machine learning

into solving complex data science and business tasks.


A data engineer's primary role is to design, build, and manage data pipelines, transforming and processing raw data into a format suitable for analysis. They work closely with data architects, who design the underlying data structure, and ensure that data is efficiently and accurately processed for downstream analytics tasks. In contrast, a data scientist focuses on analyzing data and building models, a database administrator is responsible for managing and maintaining databases, and a BI developer designs and implements BI solutions to facilitate data-driven decision making.



Not every type of analysis can be considered business

intelligence though, BI deals with the explanation

of past events using data driven approaches

and reaching data driven conclusions.

In contrast, a business analytics approach,

which is not data analytics and therefore not BI,

is SWOT analysis.

SWOT analysis is a famous type of qualitative analysis

contributing to the strategic decision making of a company.

It points out the strengths and weaknesses

of running a particular business, so a SWOT analysis

can improve the firm's strategy,

but it is not a data driven analysis
