# STANDARDIZATION
Every distribution can be standardized. Say the mean and the variance of a variable are mu and sigma squared respectively. Standardization is the process of transforming this variable
to one with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The standardized variable is called the Z-score and is equal to the original variable minus its mean
divided by its standard deviation.


# central limit theorem

STATES THAT

that no matter the underlying distribution of the data set

distribution of the sample means would be normal

with a mean equal to the original mean,

and a variance equal to the original variance

divided by the sample size.

he central limit theorem allows us

to perform tests, solve problems,

and make inferences using the normal distribution,

even when the population is not normally distributed.


The standard error is the standard deviation

of the distribution formed by the sample means.

In other words,

the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.


Note that it decreases as the sample size increases.

This makes sense, as bigger samples

give a better approximation of the population.




estimator of a population parameter.

It is an approximation

depending solely on sample information.

A specific value is called an estimate.

There are two types of estimates.

Point estimates and confidence interval estimates.

A point estimate is a single number,

while a confidence interval, naturally, is an interval.

The two are closely related

The two are closely related.

In fact, the point estimate is located exactly in the middle

of the confidence interval.

However, confidence intervals provide much more information

and are preferred when making inferences.


An unbiased estimator has an expected value

equal to the population parameter.



It is enough to know that most efficient

means the unbiased estimator with the smallest variance.

A final note worth making is about

the difference between estimators and statistics.

The word statistic is the broader term.

A point estimate is a statistic.


Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%

with respective alphas of 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Another way to put the value of alpha

is 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 respectively.

Keep in mind that a 95% confidence interval

means you are sure that in 95% of the cases,

the true population parameter would fall

into the specified interval.


Let's say that we wanna find the values

for the 95% confidence interval.

Alpha is 0.05.

Therefore, we are looking for z of alpha divided by two,

or 0.025.

In the table, this will match the value

of one minus 0.025, or 0.9775.

The corresponding z comes from the sum of the row

and column table headers associated with this cell.

In our case, the value is 1.9 plus 0.06, or 1.96.

A commonly used term for the z is critical value.

 So we have found the critical value

for this confidence interval.

Now, we can easily substitute in the formula.

The final confidence interval becomes 94,833 to 105,568.

The interpretation is the following.

We are 95% confident that the average data scientist salary

will be in the interval $94,833 and $105,568



So basically, the confidence intervals

could be summarized as follows.

The true population mean falls in the interval defined

by the sample mean plus minus the margin of error.

Now, we get to the core of this lesson.

Getting a smaller margin of error means

that the confidence interval would be narrower.

As we want a better prediction, it is in our interest

to have the narrowest possible confidence interval.

The best part is that we can control the margin of error.

The statistic and the standard deviation

are in the numerator, so smaller statistics and

smaller standard deviations will reduce the margin of error.
